# GoDoxy WebUI

This is a WebUI for GoDoxy - a reverse proxy for local services.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Tailwind
- Shadcn UI
- Next.js
- Tanstack Query
- React Hook Form
- pnpm
- motion (Framer Motion's successor)

## Current State

- Migrating from original Chakra UI to Shadcn UI + tailwindcss.
- API and most types are identical

## Missing Shadcn UI Components

- For every missing component, run `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>`

## Code Style

- DO NOT HARDCODE COLORS WITH `text-COLOR-WEIGHT`, use variables instead.
- For repetitive code, create a component under the main component then pass props to it.
- Retrieve data on a Seperate `Provider` component which do query, produce values and return null. They should be mounted on the top level of the page, or at least before the data is used.
- For single statement anonymous functions, use arrow function (no brackets!).

## Pages

- [x] Homepage: basic system info + app dashboard.
- [x] Config: edit the config files for GoDoxy.
- [x] Proxies: Table of proxies grouped by providers with tabs.
- [x] Routes: Service uptime and route details.
- [x] Servers: System info of different nodes.
- [ ] Docker: Log viewer for docker containers.

## Layout and Style

- On desktop, titlebar.
- On mobile, TBD

## Homepage

- Have a row of system infos like hostname, cpu /memory/disk usage. then other rows for apps
- Tabs grouped by categories, e.g. "Pinned", "All", "Cat 1", "Cat 2", etc.
- A search box on the same row as tab for filtering apps
Some apps might have widgets (at most 3, in a single row) with value (on top) and label (on bottom)
- Apps with widgets should take 1.5x height (same height with two apps without widgets, across rows)
- Limits tabs to 5 items, if exceeds show a combobox starting from the 4th item
- System infos should always be in a single row of 4-item grid
  - On mobile, it's displayed in a single card with css tuning
  - On desktop, every item is displayed as a card
- if enough space, widgets should be on the same row

## What you should NOT do

- Suggest workarounds for the current state, rather than fixing the issue.
- Ask to run `pnpm buikd`, `pnpm dev` and such commands unless it's explicitly asked for.
